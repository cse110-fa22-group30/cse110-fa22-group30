## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Web app

​

* Good, more streamlined for phone users
* Good, web app, not like a mobile app, can easily adapted to whatever devices the user is using
* Good, easy to maintain
* Good, users can manipulate the data on the page
* Bad, maybe slower
* Bad, require authentication
​

### site

​

* Good, It is faster to finish the project with site format
* Good, This is what CSE110 labs have been teaching and the data is easier to import.
* Good, Most computers stick to a standard aspect ratio. (16:9)
* Good, resistant to updates when compared to apps. (HTML, CSS, and JS are core foundations.)
* Neutral, The final product is built for sites. Easier for computers to use (mouse and keyboard), but harder for phones to use.
* Bad, A site like this is usually build for phones in order to be more "portable" (as compared to a laptop)
* Bad, may have less interaction with users
